description: Build a new multi-page WordPress-ready website in UiChemy from a business brief, choosing real section layouts from the UiChemy library and writing the copy. Use when the user asks to create, generate, draft or design a website, landing page or site for a business, client or idea.
---

Use this skill when the user wants a new website built from a description, a client brief, or a business type.

Inputs to gather from the user's message first: business name and type, audience, tone, pages wanted, colours or fonts if any. If the business type or name is missing, ask one batched question. For everything else, make a sensible choice and state it.

Steps:
1. Call `uichemy_section_spec` once and follow its rules for copy length, type scale and colour tokens. Do not guess limits.
2. Call `uichemy_list_section_kinds` to see which section kinds exist.
3. For each section on each page, find a layout:
   - Describe what you want to `uichemy_search_layouts`, or narrow a kind with `uichemy_find_templates`.
   - Call `uichemy_template_slots` for the chosen layout and write copy that fits each slot and its character cap.
   - Before building, call `uichemy_check_layouts` on the shortlist so two layouts that share slots do not show identical copy.
4. Pick a palette (hex values) and a heading and body font that suit the brand.
5. Call `uichemy_create_project` with the pages, palette, fonts and the copy you wrote. A real page has a navbar, five to eight sections and a footer, with every slot filled.
6. Call `uichemy_validate`, then `uichemy_check_responsive` for each page. Fix what they report with `uichemy_set_text`, `uichemy_set_section_style` or the other edit tools, then re-run the check.
7. Give the user the project name, the page list with each page's sections, the palette and fonts, and anything you could not fix.

Rules:
- Write copy from the brief only. Do not invent awards, client names, statistics, testimonials, prices or addresses. Where a fact is missing, write neutral copy or ask.
- Images: use only URLs the user supplied or that `uichemy_upload_image` returned. Leave an image slot empty rather than inventing a link.
- This skill creates a project in the user's own UiChemy account. Say so before you create it.
